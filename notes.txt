This file is for pts to be shared for the build of the project:
1 We delete the usage of php in webpage backend, and instead we will use node.js for several reasons:
    - javascript is 100% will be used in frontend while it can be used in backend where this is a huge feature for us
    - node.js is based on javascript.
    - The usage of OSM (OpenStreaMap) will need node.js for backend control.
2 The API (app prog interface) to be used for controling OSM will be "leaflet"
3 You can find the api on  https://leafletjs.com/
